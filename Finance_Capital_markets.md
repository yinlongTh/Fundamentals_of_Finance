## Interest and debt
#### Compounding Interest

<pre>
Bank : 10% compounds annually
Today -> 1 yrs ->   2 yrs   -> ...
100$  -> 110$  -> 110 + 10% -> ...

n-years we have = Deposit * (1 + r)^t
</pre>

#### The rule of 72 for Compound Interest
: make the calculation of the Compound Interest easier
<pre>Just do 72/r !!!, Damn close to how long time we need to wait to double the starting deposit</pre>

#### Interest
Terminology : Deposit is "Principal"
<pre>
100$ with r = 10% -> After a year you get 110$
</pre>
- Simple Interest
- Compound Interest

In 't' years
- Simple : Principal*(1 + r*t)
- Compound : Principal*(1 + r)^t

#### APR {Annual Percentage Rate}
<pre>
Example : 22.9% a year (22.9/365 = 0.06274% daily periodic rate)
If we take 0.06274% make compound interest for a year -> actually 25.7% a year #Called Effective APR
</pre>

#### Payday load
: Bad Choice!! Very high interest "Usury"
Example - 25% in 2 weeks

#### Continuous Compound Interest
<pre>
Principal = 50$
t = 3 years
compound 4 times a year 
r = 10%

#Solution

50*(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*3)
</pre>

#### Present Value (PV)
: When to get and to spend money does matter
<pre>
Example
- Bank 10% risk-free interest:   100$   110$        121$
- Someone offers 3 Options   :   Now    1 year  or  2 year
                                 100$   109$        120$
: Bank is the better choice <strong>#Time value of money</strong>
</pre>

Ask : What is the Present Value (PV) value 121$ in the next 2 years ? <br>
Ank : What is the Future Value (FV) value in the next year ? <br><br>
Example II
<pre>
Risk-free Rate = 5 %

          Choice 1   Choice 2   Choice 3
Today      100$                  20$         
Year1                            50$
Year2                 110$       35$

: Choice 1 - FV 2 years = 100*1.05*1.05 = 110.15$  #Best
  Choice 2 - FV 2 years = 110$
  Choice 3 - FV 2 years = 20*1.05*1.05 + 50*1.05 + 35 = 109.55$
</pre><br>

<strong>Discount Rate : Interest but when we calculate back to get PV from FV</strong>

## Housing

#### Balance Sheets
Termenology
- Assets : What we can use their value to trade | Cash / house
- Liability : Dedt right now

<pre>
Asset = Liability + Equity
</pre>
<br>
Example
<pre>
I have 250k $, want to buy a 1m $ house
I borrowed from a bank for 750k $

- Cash : 1 million $ || a house after buying
- Liability : 750k $
- Equity : 1000k - 750k = 250k $
</pre>

<strong>Marking to Market : revalue the asset to the market value</strong>
<pre>If our neighbor house price goes higher -> our Asset goes up, our equity goes up</pre>

#### Rent vs Buy
Situation 
- Have 250k $
- Rent 3k $ a month / Buy 1m $
<pre>
<strong>Consider Buying option</strong>
If we want to buy the house, mortgage 750k$ at 6% interest
which will cost 750k*6% = 45k **this can deduct my tax**

Say originally I earn 100k a year, I deduct out 45k to 55k for tax (6% assumed) calculation
But also have to pay out house Tax (1% assumed)

: In a year I have to pay 45k + 55k*6% + 1m*1% = 58.3k $ #

<strong>Consider Renting option</strong>
: In a year I have to pay 3k*12 + 100k*6% = 42k $ #

<strong>In reality we have to consider Inflation, Home appreciation and other maintainance as well</strong>
</pre>

#### Mortgage Loans
Situation
<pre>
House : 500k
Down : 125k
Loan : 500k - 125k = 375k Home Title belongs to the bank till the load is paid called <strong>"Mortgage"</strong>
</pre>
Typically shorter period of contract time, lower Interest Rate 
- 30 year fixed
- 15 year fixed
- 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) : First 5 years are fixed, changed once a year after 

#### Short Sale
If you cannot afford the house payment
- Sale : Might be able to talk with the bank to pay the change if we sale for lower than the down value
- Foreciosure : Returning the house to the bank (Bad Credit)

#### ARM : Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Intersts will depend on "1-year treasuries" and "LIBOR"

#### Ballon Payment Mortgage
- say 10 year term with 30 year rate interest, paid for 10 years then pay all principle once after 

#### Equation
<pre>
Situation
- L = Loan
- i = monthly interest
- n = # of months
- pm = monthly payment
</pre>

<pre>
1st month -> (L*(1+i)-pm)
2nd month -> ((L*(1+i)-pm)*(1+i)-pm)

We get L = pm*((1+i)^-1 + (1+i)^-2 + (1+i)^-3 + ... + (1+i)^-n)
Let r = (1+i)^-1, pm = L*(1-r)/(r-r^(n+1))
</pre>

#### Other Terminology
: Deed, Title, Escrow
________________________________________________
## Inflation
Terminology
<pre>
- CPI : Comsumer Price Index (a basket people tend to use of goods and services)
- Price Inflation : Goods & Servives
- Monetary Inflation : Increase in money supply
</pre>

#### Stagflation
When irregular inflation happened, The supply goes down, price goes up, ...
- Shock the system
- Example : Fuel cost

#### Hyperinflation
The goverment printed tons of money, Prices goes up, Print more, ...
- Money values less and less

#### Real and Nominal Return
Example
<pre>
Year ago   Now 
 100$      110$
 with 2% inflation
 
 <strong>Real Return</strong> : (110-102)/102 *100 = 7.8% 
</pre>

#### Economics of a Cupcake Factory Example
Condition
<pre>
Factory : 1 m$ to build / 500k yearly operate / 2$ each cupcake (1$ making) / 1m cupcakes each year

Rev : 2m $ per year
Cost Of Goods : 1m $ per year
Gross Profit : 2m - 1m = 1m $
Overhead : 500k $
Operating Profit (Final) : 1m - 500 k = 500k $ #Assume we have no tax and others

Capacity Utilization = (1m Sold / 1m made) * 100 = 100%
Return on Assest = (Operating Income / Innitial Investment) * 100 = 500k / 1m build = 50%
</pre>

#### Inflation Deflation and Capacity Utilization
Capacity Utilization drives the Inflation and Deflation
<pre>
Capacity Utilization up, Price up, Inflation up
</pre>

#### Obama Stimulus Plan
<pre>
Very low Capacity Utilization when the country has a lot of supply : Demand Shocked
The goverment buys some of those extra capacity.
Happened to the US after WWII
</pre>

#### Deflation despite Increase in money supply
People are not willing to use money to consume even they have money

#### Deflationary Spiral
When All the things go down and looped

<pre>
Employment Down -> Demand Down -> Supply, Price Down -> Profit Down -> Employment Down
</pre>
