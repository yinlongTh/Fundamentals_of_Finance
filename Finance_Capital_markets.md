## Interest and debt :moneybag:
#### Compounding Interest

<pre>
Bank : 10% compounds annually
Today -> 1 yrs ->   2 yrs   -> ...
100$  -> 110$  -> 110 + 10% -> ...

n-years we have = Deposit * (1 + r)^t
</pre>

#### The rule of 72 for Compound Interest
: make the calculation of the Compound Interest easier
<pre>Just do 72/r !!!, Damn close to how long time we need to wait to double the starting deposit</pre>

#### Interest
Terminology : Deposit is "Principal"
<pre>
100$ with r = 10% -> After a year you get 110$
</pre>
- Simple Interest
- Compound Interest

In 't' years
- Simple : Principal*(1 + r*t)
- Compound : Principal*(1 + r)^t

![300px-Compound_interest_(English)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180972047-c740cc65-1809-4914-ad0b-218583b84094.gif)


#### APR {Annual Percentage Rate}
<pre>
Example : 22.9% a year (22.9/365 = 0.06274% daily periodic rate)
If we take 0.06274% make compound interest for a year -> actually 25.7% a year #Called Effective APR
</pre>

#### Payday loan
: Bad Choice!! Very high interest "Usury"
Example - 25% in 2 weeks

#### Continuous Compound Interest
<pre>
Principal = 50$
t = 3 years
compound 4 times a year 
r = 10%

#Solution

50*(1 + 0.10/4)^(4*3)
</pre>

#### Present Value (PV)
: When to get and to spend money does matter
<pre>
Example
- Bank 10% risk-free interest:   100$   110$        121$
- Someone offers 3 Options   :   Now    1 year  or  2 year
                                 100$   109$        120$
: Bank is the better choice <strong>#Time value of money</strong>
</pre>

Ask : What is the Present Value (PV) value 121$ in the next 2 years ? <br>
Ank : What is the Future Value (FV) value in the next year ? <br><br>
Example II
<pre>
Risk-free Rate = 5 %

          Choice 1   Choice 2   Choice 3
Today      100$                  20$         
Year1                            50$
Year2                 110$       35$

: Choice 1 - FV 2 years = 100*1.05*1.05 = 110.15$  #Best
  Choice 2 - FV 2 years = 110$
  Choice 3 - FV 2 years = 20*1.05*1.05 + 50*1.05 + 35 = 109.55$
</pre><br>

<strong>Discount Rate : Interest but when we calculate back to get PV from FV</strong>

## Housing :house_with_garden:

#### Balance Sheets
Termenology
- Assets : What we can use their value to trade | Cash / house
- Liability : Debt right now

<pre>
Asset = Liability + Equity
</pre>

<img width="566" alt="image1-9" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180971429-ce2c150a-d216-4124-86c5-6aacf035b300.png">

<br>
Example
<pre>
I have 250k $, want to buy a 1m $ house
I borrowed from a bank for 750k $

- Cash : 1 million $ || a house after buying
- Liability : 750k $
- Equity : 1000k - 750k = 250k $
</pre>

<strong>Marking to Market : revalue the asset to the market value</strong>
<pre>If our neighbor house price goes higher -> our Asset goes up, our equity goes up</pre>

#### Rent vs Buy
Situation 
- Have 250k $
- Rent 3k $ a month / Buy 1m $
<pre>
<strong>Consider Buying option</strong>
If we want to buy the house, mortgage 750k$ at 6% interest
which will cost 750k*6% = 45k **this can deduct my tax**

Say originally I earn 100k a year, I deduct out 45k to 55k for tax (6% assumed) calculation
But also have to pay out house Tax (1% assumed)

: In a year I have to pay 45k + 55k*6% + 1m*1% = 58.3k $ #

<strong>Consider Renting option</strong>
: In a year I have to pay 3k*12 + 100k*6% = 42k $ #

<strong>In reality we have to consider Inflation, Home appreciation and other maintainance as well</strong>
</pre>

#### Mortgage Loans
Situation
<pre>
House : 500k
Down : 125k
Loan : 500k - 125k = 375k Home Title belongs to the bank till the load is paid called <strong>"Mortgage"</strong>
</pre>
Typically shorter period of contract time, lower Interest Rate 
- 30 year fixed
- 15 year fixed
- 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) : First 5 years are fixed, changed once a year after 

![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180973852-ce3f897f-4c88-4687-9663-9957809d407a.jpg)


#### Short Sale
If you cannot afford the house payment
- Sale : Might be able to talk with the bank to pay the change if we sale for lower than the down value
- Foreciosure : Returning the house to the bank (Bad Credit)

#### ARM : Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Intersts will depend on "1-year treasuries" and "LIBOR"

#### Ballon Payment Mortgage
- say 10 year term with 30 year rate interest, paid for 10 years then pay all principle once after 

#### Equation
<pre>
Situation
- L = Loan
- i = monthly interest
- n = # of months
- pm = monthly payment
</pre>

<pre>
1st month -> (L*(1+i)-pm)
2nd month -> ((L*(1+i)-pm)*(1+i)-pm)

We get L = pm*((1+i)^-1 + (1+i)^-2 + (1+i)^-3 + ... + (1+i)^-n)
Let r = (1+i)^-1, pm = L*(1-r)/(r-r^(n+1))
</pre>

#### Other Terminology
: Deed, Title, Escrow
________________________________________________
## Inflation :chart:
Terminology
<pre>
- CPI : Comsumer Price Index (a basket people tend to use of goods and services)
- Price Inflation : Goods & Servives
- Monetary Inflation : Increase in money supply
</pre>

![consumerpriceindex-FINAL-700b87f61f1441419c9d1562e6537f86](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180974296-563a806a-51d0-4020-a30e-266aa95b30ab.png)


#### Stagflation
When irregular inflation happened, The supply goes down, price goes up, ...
- Shock the system
- Example : Fuel cost

![stagflation-explanation-as-stagnation-inflation-crisis-outline-diagram-labeled-educational-gdp-unemployment-demand-financial-233538667](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180974556-4db3c5bb-29c8-4d68-8248-43f7a054fe0d.jpg)

#### Hyperinflation
The goverment printed tons of money, Prices goes up, Print more, ...
- Money values less and less

![what-is-hyperinflation-definition-causes-and-examples-3306097-Final-58ea47ee1dd94b16b061214dcc8dae77](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180974862-3786de72-3820-4e23-ae1f-d96d7be98819.png)


#### Real and Nominal Return
Example
<pre>
Year ago   Now 
 100$      110$
 with 2% inflation
 
 <strong>Real Return</strong> : (110-102)/102 *100 = 7.8% 
</pre>

#### Economics of a Cupcake Factory Example
Condition
<pre>
Factory : 1 m$ to build / 500k yearly operate / 2$ each cupcake (1$ making) / 1m cupcakes each year

Rev : 2m $ per year  #Money from the sold
Cost Of Goods : 1m $ per year  #Money Used in production
Gross Profit : 2m - 1m = 1m $
Overhead : 500k $
Operating Profit (Final) : 1m - 500 k = 500k $ #Assume we have no tax and others

Capacity Utilization = (1m Sold / 1m made) * 100 = 100%
Return on Assest = (Operating Income / Innitial Investment) * 100 = 500k / 1m build = 50%
</pre>

![dotdash_Final_Income_Statement_Aug_2020-021-eb8d8819386649a898bb94fd7ca3abf8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180976224-c9e80e9e-d0f6-493f-bfda-ab6c2894d6a5.jpg)


#### Inflation Deflation and Capacity Utilization
Capacity Utilization drives the Inflation and Deflation
<pre>
Capacity Utilization up, Price up, Inflation up
</pre>

#### Obama Stimulus Plan
<pre>
Very low Capacity Utilization when the country has a lot of supply : Demand Shocked
The goverment buys some of those extra capacity.
Happened to the US after WWII
</pre>

#### Deflation despite Increase in money supply
People are not willing to use money to consume even they have money

#### Deflationary Spiral
When All the things go down and looped

<pre>
Employment Down -> Demand Down -> Supply, Price Down -> Profit Down -> Employment Down
</pre>

## Taxes :clipboard:

### Personal Taxes
#### US Income Tax Rates

![3 1 5 t1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/180981096-42c15320-3906-4721-b007-b1b5b3717b4f.png)

#### AMT : Alternative Minimum Tax
The other way to calculate a person's Tax and cannot be deducted.
<pre>
If the person's Tax after the deduction is lower than AMT, <br>
The person has to pay AMT for their Tax instead
</pre>

![3 3 1 t1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/181142274-34462e8e-f61c-46f6-aa97-f2cc3e94eacb.png)

#### Estate Tax
: Tax on someone estate or someone passed away leaved to another person
<pre>
As known as
- Inheriance Tax
- Death Tax
</pre>
Example :
- Exempt for first $5m, 35% after that
<pre>
$6m -> Estate -> Daughter
: Pay tax for $1m
</pre>

### Coporate Taxation
Coporation - Legal entity can act like a person
- Limited Liability : Means If the Company runs properly, The company can only lose what it value, not people.
- Share ownership


#### Double Taxation
- Does not happend with S-corp / LLC / LP / LLP #Small
- C-corp #Large
<pre>
Situation :
$1000 Profit
30% Tax = $300
$700 Net Income

This Net Income is devided to shareholders, shareholders have to pay tax again as well. 
</pre>

#### Transfer Pricing and Tax Havens
Example
<pre>
In ths US : Tax 35%
Company in the state earns $1m
In another small island : Tax 5%

The US company pay their money to their small company in that small island to pay less tax.
This seem great. But on the way transfer money back, the small company has to pay tax as well.
</pre>

## Accounting and financial statements

#### Cash Accounting
- Revenue : Money received from clients / Customers
- Expense : Money spent for making Rev
Cash Account

![CashAccount](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/181150991-c516492a-8af5-4f06-91d6-3495b1533e1c.png)

#### Accrual Basis of Accounting
: Account all the deals we have both cash and non-cash at a time
- Account Receivable : Money people owe you

![AccrualAccount](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/181151855-d14043ca-74e2-4eec-aca5-e1deaa9a9955.png)

#### Accrual vs Cash accounting
- Accrual better reflect the company's plans / dedication 

### 3 Core Statements
<pre>
- Income Statement : Rev, Exp, Net
- Balance Sheet : Liability, Equity, Asset
- Cash flow Statement : only see cash and account A.R. (Account Receivable) as negative, A.P. (Account Payable) as positive
</pre>
Without A.P.<br>
![CashFlowSt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/181155660-df9026fb-3467-4706-966b-854bc39dee64.png)

With A.P.<br>
![AP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108507768/181156304-7741ef98-df45-4c21-8a2c-6ce2c452c4ed.png)

#### Fair Value Accounting
Situation : Sheep land
<pre>
<strong>Asset</strong>
         Year 1   Year 2
Sheep      1m      1.2m
Land       1m      1.2m  (Historical Cost)
           2m      1.9m  (Fair Value : Updated according to the markets) 
</pre>

#### Depreciation & Amortization
Situation : 
<pre>
Year      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
Rev      100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  100
Labor     50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50   50
Truck     20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20   20
Profit    30  30  30  30  30  30  30  30  30   30
</pre>

<pre>
First we have 60k$
Truck Life spend : 3 years
Truck Cost : 60k

If we account the truck cost 60k in the first year, The <strong>Income Statement</strong> would look very bad for that year.
Depreciating spread 60k to 20k for 3 years instead.

<strong>In Balance Sheet</strong>
Asset truck : 60k Change to 40k 20k 0
</pre>

<strong>Cash flow Statement</strong>
<pre>
                   Year 1   Year 2
Starting Cash        60      50
Profit               30      30
Depreciation         20      20
Cash from Operation  50      50  (30+20) #We own the truck value
Capital EXP          60      0
Ending Cash          50      100
</pre>
