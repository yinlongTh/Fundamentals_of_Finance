</pre>

Example
<pre>
I have 250k $, want to buy a 1m $ house
I borrowed from a bank for 750k $

- Cash : 1 million $ || a house after buying
- Liability : 750k $
- Equity : 1000k - 750k = 250k $
</pre>

<strong>Marking to Market : revalue the asset to the market value</strong>
<pre>If our neighbor house price goes higher -> our Asset goes up, our equity goes up</pre>

#### Rent vs Buy
Situation 
- Have 250k $
- Rent 3k $ a month / Buy 1m $
<pre>
<strong>Consider Buying option</strong>
If we want to buy the house, mortgage 750k$ at 6% interest
which will cost 750k*6% = 45k **this can deduct my tax**

Say originally I earn 100k a year, I deduct out 45k to 55k for tax (6% assumed) calculation
But also have to pay out house Tax (1% assumed)

: In a year I have to pay 45k + 55k*6% + 1m*1% = 58.3k $ #

<strong>Consider Renting option</strong>
: In a year I have to pay 3k*12 + 100k*6% = 42k $ #

<strong>In reality we have to consider Inflation, Home appreciation and other maintainance as well</strong>
</pre>

#### Mortgage Loans
Situation
<pre>
House : 500k
Down : 125k
Loan : 500k - 125k = 375k Home Title belongs to the bank till the load is paid called <strong>"Mortgage"</strong>
</pre>
Typically shorter period of contract time, lower Interest Rate 
- 30 year fixed
- 15 year fixed
- 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) : First 5 years are fixed, changed once a year after

#### Short Sale
If you cannot afford the house payment
- Sale : Might be able to talk with the bank to pay the change if we sale for lower than the down value
- Foreciosure : Returning the house to the bank (Bad Credit)

#### ARM : Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Intersts will depend on "1-year treasuries" and "LIBOR"

#### Ballon Payment Mortgage
- say 10 year term with 30 year rate interest, paid for 10 years then pay all principle once after 

#### Equation
<pre>
Situation
- L = Loan
- i = monthly interest
- n = # of months
- pm = monthly payment
</pre>

<pre>
1st month -> (L*(1+i)-pm)
2nd month -> ((L*(1+i)-pm)*(1+i)-pm)

We get L = pm*((1+i)^-1 + (1+i)^-2 + (1+i)^-3 + ... + (1+i)^-n)
Let r = (1+i)^-1, pm = L*(1-r)/(r-r^(n+1))
</pre>

#### Other Terminology
: Deed, Title, Escrow
