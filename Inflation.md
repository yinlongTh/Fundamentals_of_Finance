 <strong>Real Return</strong> : (110-102)/102 *100 = 7.8%

#### Economics of a Cupcake Factory Example
Condition
<pre>
Factory : 1 m$ to build / 500k yearly operate / 2$ each cupcake (1$ making) / 1m cupcakes each year

Rev : 2m $ per year  #Money from the sold
Cost Of Goods : 1m $ per year  #Money Used in production
Gross Profit : 2m - 1m = 1m $
Overhead : 500k $
Operating Profit (Final) : 1m - 500 k = 500k $ #Assume we have no tax and others

Capacity Utilization = (1m Sold / 1m made) * 100 = 100%
Return on Assest = (Operating Income / Innitial Investment) * 100 = 500k / 1m build = 50%
</pre>
